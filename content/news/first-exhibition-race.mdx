Horns up, visors down.

This past weekend was our very first introduction to the Lone Star Cup with our exhibition race, and we couldn’t imagine a better way to put our foot on the throttle and push towards the beginning of our season. Graciously hosted by SimATX, we had a turnout of over ten people (and even more who joined from the comforts of their homes), most of which were quite new to sim racing, itching to feel the same adrenaline we do behind the wheel – experiencing the joys (and frustrations) of sim racing. 

The range of skill was astounding, with some people driving as if they’ve been behind the wheel their entire life, to people who have experienced their very first corners. And yes, even if some of you guys were more familiar with the reverse gear than sixth gear, watching each of your lap times get better and better brought more joy to me than a new personal best at Zandvoort (and believe me, that’s a feat in itself). Huge congratulations to everyone’s performance – each of you fought with the rigorous intensity of a championship-deciding final lap.

We can’t wait to see y’all at our first official race at Daytona on Saturday! Helmets on, visors down, gloves tight, and hands on the wheel – our season is about to begin, and the lights are ticking down.
