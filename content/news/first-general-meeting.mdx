It’s lights off and away we go! 

Our general meeting exceeded any expectation I could have imagined; from the start, I was admittedly nervous, since we had scheduled it during a basketball game, a Benson Boone concert, and right at the prime time when every other club decided to hold a meeting as well. Despite all of this, our turnout was incredible – over forty people attended our first meeting, each and every one equally excited for the future of our club. I’m not even mad I lost the bet on how many people appeared – I would lose the bet an infinite more amount of times if it could replicate the same enthusiasm we had that very day.

The mishaps brought more joy than embarrassment – from George dropping the microphone (proving us dubbing him Leorge Gawrence), the lights refusing to find a happy medium where we weren’t scorchingly blinded (the lights took “lights out and away we go” a tad too seriously), to Dylan accidentally doxxing his address, hearing the laughter from everyone took the admittedly mortifying situations to a lighthearted, memorable moment – hopefully the first of many. We had only been together for thirty minutes, but we were already forming the bonds LSR could only dreamed of: a motorsport community full of joy and passion, accelerating towards a finish line we could barely see a couple of months ago.

Thank you so much to everyone who showed up, thank you for laughing with us, thank you for being around us and forming connections. This is just the starting line – our tires are still cold, our engines still desperately warming up, but I don’t doubt our future pace. We are so excited to see where the rest of our season takes us—from screaming at the TV for yet another Ferrari mistake during our watch parties to watching rookie drivers thrive under the Lone Star Cup. We can’t wait to grow alongside everyone, bridging the gap between the sim racing world and the broader motorsport community.
